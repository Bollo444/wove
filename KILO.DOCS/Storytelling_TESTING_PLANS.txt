### V. Test Management & Reporting

*   **Test Case Management:** Use a tool like TestRail, Zephyr, or even well-organized spreadsheets for smaller teams.
*   **Bug Tracking:** JIRA, Trello, Asana. Bugs should be detailed with steps to reproduce, actual vs. expected results, severity, priority, and environment.
*   **Reporting:** Regular test execution reports, bug status reports, test coverage metrics.

### VI. Release Criteria (Example)

*   All P1 (Critical) and P2 (High) bugs are fixed and verified.
*   95%+ of planned test cases executed.
*   85%+ test case pass rate for functional tests.
*   No outstanding critical security vulnerabilities.
*   Successful completion of UAT with sign-off from key stakeholders for each age tier.
*   Performance metrics meet defined targets.
*   Compliance requirements (COPPA, etc.) are met.

This comprehensive testing strategy, tailored to the specific features and risks of the Interactive Storytelling Platform, is crucial for delivering a high-quality, engaging, and safe product.
